## HashMaps
Today, I learned about one of the types of Data Structures called HashMaps. HashMaps are
basically consisting of a key and its value (key-value pairs). 

For instance, if you remember we used to get one roll number when we were in the school 
which was used for many academic purposes. So, we can say that in this case, the roll number
is the key and the student to whom it is being allocated is the value. Therefore, whenever 
we need any details of a particular student we can easily get that information through
their key. 

Such data structure makes it easier for the user to quickly retrieve data from a database or
data structure. Moreover, having a unique key to access data directly, rather than searching 
through all data makes HashMaps faster than other data structures (time complexity-O(1)).
